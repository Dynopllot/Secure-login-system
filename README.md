# Secure Login System â€“ Cybersecurity Edition

## Objective
Build a modern, secure Django login system with advanced security features and a cyber-themed user interface, suitable for real-world applications and cybersecurity demonstrations.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (custom cyber-themed styling)
- **Database:** SQLite (default, can be swapped)
- **Security:** bcrypt, IPQualityScore API, Django messages, custom middleware

## Features
- Custom user model with bcrypt password hashing
- IP blocking after 3 failed login attempts
- VPN/Proxy detection (IPQualityScore API)
- Email alerts on failed logins
- Logging of login attempts
- Cybersecurity-themed UI (dark, neon, modern)
- All error/block messages styled in the login box

## How It Works
1. **User Registration & Login:**
   - Users register and log in using a custom user model.
   - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt for strong security.
2. **Login Security:**
   - All login attempts are logged.
   - After 3 failed attempts from the same IP, that IP is temporarily blocked.
   - If a VPN/proxy is detected (via IPQualityScore), login is blocked and a warning is shown.
3. **Alerts & Monitoring:**
   - Failed logins trigger email alerts to the admin/user.
   - All events are logged for audit and monitoring.
4. **User Experience:**
   - All error and block messages are shown in a cyber-themed, styled login box.
   - Dashboard displays security features and tips after login.

**Descriptions:**
- **Login Page:** login form with styled error messages and security feedback.
- **Register Page:** Secure registration form with custom user model and styled validation.
- **Cybersecurity Dashboard:** After login, users see a dashboard summarizing security features and tips.
- **IP Blocked Message:** After 3 failed login attempts, the user's IP is temporarily blocked and a styled message is shown.
- **VPN/Proxy Blocked Message:** If a VPN or proxy is detected, login is blocked and a warning is displayed.
- **Email Alert Example:** Shows the alert email sent to the admin/user on failed login attempts.

## Quick Start
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Dynopllot/Secure-login-system.git
   cd Secure-login-system
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run migrations:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
4. **Create a superuser:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
5. **Run the server:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage
- Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/` to log in.
- Register a new user or log in with your superuser credentials.
- After 3 failed login attempts from the same IP, that IP will be blocked.
- If VPN/Proxy is detected (using IPQualityScore), login is blocked and a message is shown.
- All failed logins are logged to `logs/login_attempts.log`.
- Email alerts are sent on failed logins (configure your email in `settings.py`).

## API Integration (IPQualityScore)
- The system uses the [IPQualityScore IP Reputation API](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/documentation/proxy-detection/overview) to detect VPN/proxy usage.
- Set your API key in `settings.py`:
  ```python
  IPQUALITYSCORE_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
  ```
- The API is called in `accounts/views.py`:
  ```python
  resp = requests.get(f'https://ipqualityscore.com/api/json/ip/{API_KEY}/{ip}', timeout=5)
  data = resp.json()
  if data.get('proxy'):
      # Block login
  ```
- For local development, you may want to skip proxy checks for `127.0.0.1`.

## Configuration
- Set your email and IPQualityScore API key in `settings.py`.
- To disable VPN/proxy blocking for local dev, set `VPN_PROXY_BLOCK_ENABLED = False` in `settings.py`.

## Security Notes
- For local development, VPN/proxy detection may block localhost. Adjust as needed.
- All error/block messages are shown in the cyber-themed login box.
